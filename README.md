# SVG Logo Maker
Use this Node.js command-line application to generate a logo for you by answering a series of prompts.

## Description
Do you need a logo for your company or brand, but don't want to hire a graphic designer? Or maybe you need it quickly, and don't have time to make one yourself. Either way, use this Node.js application to generate a simple SVG logo that is customized for you! By creating this application, I was able to practice my skills in object-oriented programming and test-driven development.

## Installation 
To use this application, you will need to install inquirer and Node.js.

## Usage
After cloning this repo to your local machine, simply run the application in the terminal using "node index.js". You will then receive a series of prompts regarding the design of your logo. After answering all of the prompts, a logo.svg file will be created with your new SVG logo.
